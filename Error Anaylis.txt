Docid : 5350934 1 {Passage : "Xylem and phloem are the two types of vascular tissues found in plants. Xylem tissues transport water from the roots throughout the plant, while phloem transports food (suga \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 rs) from photosysnthesis throughout the plant. Xylem: tubes that brings water and minerals from the roots into the leaf.Phloem: tubes that usually move sap, with dissolved sucrose, produced by photosynthesis in the leaf, out of the leaf and to other parts of the plant.Both are found in the central vascular bundle. Basically, xylem tranports water and phloem transports organic substances.Xylem is a tissue found in vascular plants that transorts water and dissolved mineral nutrients. It consists of hollow vessels that are formed from cells joined end to end in flowering plants.ylem: tubes that brings water and minerals from the roots into the leaf.

Docid : 4648414 3 {Passage : "The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.Xylem can be found: 1  in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants. 2  in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants.n most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes."}
